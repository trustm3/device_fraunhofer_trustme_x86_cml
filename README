The *_cml device should provide a boot.img to be flashed on the trust|me phones.
It includes a kernel (from *-kernel) and the basic CML components which are
statically linked and stored on the ramdisk. The kernel and the ramdisk are put
together in the boot.img. The system.img produced by this device can be ignored.
